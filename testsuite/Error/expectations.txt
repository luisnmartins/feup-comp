Here is a brief list of the expected errors:

    -array2_err.class
        Gramatical errors
            At line 8: .length is not accepted by the grammatic rules
            At line 21: << is not allowed to be part of exprtest

    -array4_err.class
        Gramatical errors 
            At line 8 functions (unless from io class) cant receive strings as parameters
            At line 14 there is a random 2
            Rest of errors are ignored because of the error on line 14

    -aval1_err.class
        Gramatical errors: 
            At line 3 declaration of function main with a constant value like 2 is not possible


    -aval2_err.class
        Gramatical errors:
            At line 7 else statement needs to be in {}
            At line 18 3.4 is not a valid operation or number


    -aval3_err.class
        Gramatical errors:
            At line 6 operations can only be done between 2 values at a time a+b+c+d is not allowed only a+b for example
            At line 7 arithmetic operation cannot be done inside of if exprtest
            At line 14 declaration of variable outside of any function, global variables can only be declared before any function is created

    -aval4_err.class
        Gramatical errors:
            At line 6, while1 is not considered a while statement
            At line 8, there is an error because line 7 doenst end with ;
            At line 15, there cannot be ; inside of a call


    -aval5_err.class
        Gramatical errors:
            At line 16, common like ',' can only be used on calls and function declaration
            At line 18, string are only allowed on the call of io functions

    -aval6_err.class
        Gramatical errors:
            At line 4, any variable name cant start with a number
            At line 5, again , strings are never allowed only io calls
            At line 10, there is no booleans so while needs to have an exprtest
            At line 13, compares operator can only be used inside of exprtest from whiles and ifs
            At line 23, an else statement can only be used after an if
            At line 26, similar to error on line 23;

    -aval7_err.class
        Gramatical errors:
            At line 5, an else statement can only be used after an if, no variable can be called 'else' (is a secured word)
            At line 7,arithmetic operation cannot be done inside of if exprtest
            At line 8, operator &&& doesnt exist only &
            At line 9, exprtest can only be a == 1 (or a == b of course) never 1 == a;



    -err1.class
        Gramatical errors:
            At line 4, global scalar variables cant be instanciated with other variables 

    -errorArrayCompare.class
        Semantic errors:
            At line 3, compares can only be done between scalar values, 'a' and 'b' are both arrays
            At line 2, detects that return value cannot be initialized because of the error detected on line 3

    -errorResizeArray.class
        Semantic errors:
            At line 3, array size cannot be changed like a.size = X;

    -errorSharedScope.class
        Semantic errors:
            At line 3, variable 'a' is already being assumed as scalar so it cannot be turned to an array

    -errorUninitializedOutput.class
         Semantic errors:
            At line 2, return variable 'y' of f() is never initialized inside of the function
