CHECKPOINT 2 FEEDBACK
=====================
Class 5 - Group 56

These notes are based on an analysis of commit b662aaec07395a5256f0184a6c6e8ad32ea58166.
If you believe this is an error, contact your class teacher.
=====================

High-priority:
	- Attempting to compile an empty module results in a NullPointerException.
	- Attempting to compile a module with at least one empty function results in a
NullPointerException.
	- Incorrect function signature for external functions. Functions should only
end in ")V" when they do not return anything. If they have an output variable, they
must either be ")I" (for integers) or ")[I" (for arrays).

Low-priority:
	- Use packages, instead of Java's default package
