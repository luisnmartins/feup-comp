Class 5 - Group 56

If you believe this is an error, contact your class teacher.
=====================

High-priority:
	- Nothing.

Low-priority:
	- Use packages, instead of Java's default package
	- Stop after the first 10 parser errors
	- Consider outputting "prettier" (i.e., cleaner and more informative) error messages.
	- By convention, Java class names should be specified in PascalCase, so "parser" should be "Parser".
	- In Element(), "(...|{})" would be more clear as "(...)?".
