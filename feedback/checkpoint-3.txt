CHECKPOINT 3 FEEDBACK
=====================
Class 1 - Group 56

These notes are based on an analysis of commit 27fe12e990f630494625cb444e25337d491e67dd.
If you believe this is an error, contact your class teacher.
=====================

High-priority:
	- "call-main.yal": Incorrect signature when calling "main". The function should take a
single dummy "String[]" argument (and a corresponding null value should be pushed onto the
stack).
	- "nested-branch.yal": Duplicated label "if_end0".

Low-priority:
	- Consider using "iconst_5" instead of "biconst 5". Also, iconst_m1 can be used instead
of "biconst -1".
